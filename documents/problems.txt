Q:  org/springframework/boot/maven/RepackageMojo has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime
(class file version 61.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 55.0

A: java version incompatibility issues. Mine was using JDK 8 as environment and IntelliJ using 17. Upgrading to Spring boot 3.x
   requires java 17 minimum, and I was still using 2.7.x which is fine with java 8.

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
    nano ~/.bashrc
    export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk-17
    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

    switch back to java 8

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
    nano ~/.bashrc
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

    check java version
    java -version



Q: "Unable to find main class" for library module like common and util module.

A: caused by parent pom file having build for all its sub/child module

    this will make common and util class to build/find main class. only have it in module that needs it.
    create plugin management instead.
    	<build>
    		<plugins>
    			<plugin>
    				<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    				<artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    			</plugin>
    		</plugins>
    	</build>
